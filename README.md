## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how **Fragpeek** (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application on Android and iOS. 

The App provides CS2 match stats, rankings, and performance insights using publicly available data. The App is an independent tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to FACEIT.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide (FACEIT Login)
When you log in using your FACEIT account via OAuth, we receive limited information from FACEIT’s authentication system to identify your profile:
* Username
* Player ID (GUID)
* Public profile information
* Access Token (stored locally on your device only)

**Note:** We do not create or maintain separate user accounts on our own servers. Your login credentials (password) are handled entirely by FACEIT and are never seen or stored by the App.

### B. Automatically Collected Information (Analytics)
We use **Firebase Analytics** to understand how users interact with the App. This data is anonymous and aggregated. It may include:
* Device information (model, OS version)
* App usage data (screen views, session duration)
* General location (country-level)
* Anonymous identifiers
* Crash and performance data

We do **not** use analytics for advertising or profiling purposes.

## 3. How We Use Information
We use the collected information to:
* Authenticate you through FACEIT
* Display your personalized player statistics
* Improve app performance and stability
* Monitor and fix technical crashes

**We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties.**

## 4. Data Storage and Retention
The App operates on a **"Privacy by Design"** principle:
* **No Server-Side Storage:** We do not store your personal data, FACEIT ID, or tokens on our own remote servers. 
* **Local Caching:** Your FACEIT User ID and Access Token are stored **locally** on your device to maintain your session.
* **Retention:** Analytics data is processed by Google (Firebase) and is typically retained according to their standard 14-month cycle for aggregated data.

## 5. Data Sharing
Data is only shared with the following essential third-party service providers:
* **[FACEIT](https://corporate.faceit.com/privacy/):** For authentication and statistics retrieval.
* **[Google Firebase](https://policies.google.com/privacy):** For app analytics and crash reporting.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. Because login requires a FACEIT account, users must meet [FACEIT’s age requirements](https://corporate.faceit.com/privacy/). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 7. Security
We use industry-standard technical measures, including HTTPS encryption for all data in transit, to protect your information. Since no data is stored on our servers, the primary security of your account rests with your FACEIT credentials.

## 8. Your Rights and Data Deletion
Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR in the EU or CCPA in California), you have rights regarding your data. 

**How to delete your data:**
* **Immediate Deletion:** Since we do not store your data on a server, you can delete all locally stored data and tokens by simply **Logging Out** of the App or **Uninstalling** the App from your device.
* **Revoking Access:** To fully disconnect the App from your FACEIT account, you can manage your "Authorized Applications" within your FACEIT Account Settings.
* **Requests:** For any questions regarding your rights, contact us at `dzenanbecirovicc@gmail.com`.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date."
