## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **[Your App Name]** ("the App") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application.

The App provides statistical information related to the platform FACEIT. This App is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to FACEIT.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide (FACEIT Login)

When you log in using your FACEIT account, we may receive limited account information via FACEIT’s authentication system, such as:

- Username  
- Player ID  
- Profile information made publicly available  
- Email address (if provided by FACEIT and authorized by you)

This information is used solely for authentication and retrieving your statistics.

We do not create separate accounts outside of FACEIT authentication.

---

### B. Automatically Collected Information (Analytics)

We use Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with the App.

Firebase Analytics may collect:

- Device information (model, operating system version)  
- App usage data (screen views, session duration)  
- General location (country-level only)  
- Anonymous identifiers  
- Crash and performance data  

This data is aggregated and used only to improve app functionality and stability.

We do **not** use analytics for advertising purposes.

---

## 3. How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

- Authenticate users through FACEIT  
- Display personalized player statistics  
- Improve app performance and features  
- Monitor crashes and technical issues  
- Maintain app security  

We do **not** sell or rent user data.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- Authentication is handled securely through FACEIT’s OAuth system.  
- Analytics data is processed by Firebase.  
- We do not store sensitive personal data on our own servers unless required for app functionality.

Data retention policies follow the respective third-party providers.

---

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not sell personal data.

Data may be processed by the following third parties:

- FACEIT – for authentication and statistics retrieval  
- Firebase – for analytics and performance monitoring  

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum legal age in your country).

Because login requires a FACEIT account, users must meet FACEIT’s age requirements.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 7. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user data.

All authentication requests are handled through secure communication protocols (HTTPS).

---

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR in the EU or CCPA in California), you may have the right to:

- Request access to your data  
- Request correction  
- Request deletion  

To make a request, contact us at:

[your@email.com]

Some data may be controlled by third-party providers (FACEIT or Firebase), and you may need to contact them directly.
